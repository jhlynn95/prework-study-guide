## Description

Welcome to the prework study guide that I have created to start the beginning steps in becoming a developer. The reason I have created this study guide is to help me learn the beginning steps in basic web applications and what goes into it.look back to it at in the future of what I have accomplished and how much farther I can go. It has helped me learn to start and debug my code, learn to how to use github and gitbash to push my code. Javascript and its functions and what for loops are used for and its variables.

The usage of this study guide is to help elaborate on how to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git and define what certain terms mean so it's not so confusing. Each topic has some important details that I found interesting to help you understand.
